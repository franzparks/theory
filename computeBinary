/*
Write a method to compute the binary representation of a positive integer. The method should return a string with 1s and 0s. 

computeBinary(6) ==> "110"
computeBinary(5) ==> "101"

Note: Use the minimum number of binary digits needed for the representation (Truncate unnecessary trailing 0s).
computeBinary(5) ==> "0101" (incorrect)
computeBinary(5) ==> "101" (correct)
